            <h1>Void <span>ꕤ</span></h1>
            <p>Void is a decentralized platform where devices worldwide contribute their computational power to train AI
            models. The platform leverages a distributed network of nodes, from individual computers to large-scale mining farms,
            enabling AI model training at a fraction of the cost associated with traditional cloud services.
            <br>
            <br>
            The platform operates by splitting datasets based on the available resources of participating devices, sending portions
            of the data to nodes for training. Once the training is complete, the models are aggregated at the central hub to form a
            global model.
            <br>
            <br>
            In return, contributors (nodes) are rewarded with a cryptocurrency that is minted based on the resources
            used in training, creating a self-rewarding ecosystem.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our goal is to democratize access to AI training, making it accessible to developers, startups, and businesses while
            repurposing underutilized hardware like older mining equipment for real-world AI training purposes. By merging the power
            of blockchain and AI, we aim to create a system where AI development is affordable, efficient, and globally distributed.
